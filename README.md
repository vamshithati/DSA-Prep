## Arrays Fundamentals

Welcome to Day 1 of my 100-day Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation journey! Today's focus was on understanding the basics of arrays and tackling two fundamental problems.

### Problems Solved:

1.  **Two Sum**
    * **Description:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
    * **Approach:** (Briefly explain your approach, e.g., "Used a hash map to store elements and their indices for efficient lookup.")
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N) (if using hash map)
    * **Space Complexity:** O(N) (if using hash map)
    * https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/submissions/1682807529

2.  **Contains Duplicate**
    * **Description:** Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
    * **Approach:** (Briefly explain your approach, e.g., "Used a hash set to store encountered numbers and check for duplicates.")
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N) (if using hash set/map, as each element is inserted/checked once)
    * **Space Complexity:** O(N) (in the worst case, if all elements are distinct and stored in the hash set)
    * https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/submissions/1682863242

### What I Learned Today:

* Refreshed my understanding of array properties and operations.
* Practiced identifying optimal approaches for common array problems.
* Gained hands-on experience with hash maps/dictionaries/sets for efficient lookup and tracking.

### Looking Forward:

Excited for Day 2 and continuing to build a strong foundation in DSA!
